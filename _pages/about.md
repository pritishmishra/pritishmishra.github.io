## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/) at
the [University of Toronto](http://www.toronto.edu/). I am part of
the [Computer Systems and Networks Group](http://csng.cs.toronto.edu/) working under the supervision
of [Prof. Eyal de Lara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/). My current research addresses challenges in building and
optimizing
large-scale distributed systems, with a particular focus on streaming applications deployed on edge and cloud computing
infrastructure. My work has been published in leading venues, including IEEE Wireless Communications, Symposium on Edge
Computing, IEEE CloudNet, EuroSys, and EDBT.

All of my research works are in the general area of Distributed Systems with a focus on Cloud and Edge Computing,
Serverless, IoT and Software-Defined Networking. In the last few years, I have built holistic data management solutions
to optimize the deployment and management of AI applications on distributed infrastructure.

I recently co-founded VantEdge Labs, a startup that aims to build a platform for deploying and managing AI applications
in distributed computing infrastructure.

I have received multiple recognitions for my work. Some notable ones include the Best Paper Award at the ACM/IEEE
Symposium on Edge Computing, Connaught Innovation Award (CAD $50K) and SAP Stellar Award for Nascent Entrepreneurship.

In addition to my academic research, I bring five years of industrial experience
from [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/corporate/en/company/innovation/sap-labs.html), where I contributed to
the development of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering for SAP Cloud.

During my stint at SAP Labs, I was a major contributor to many open-source projects. I also got an opportunity to
publish 8 papers and file 8 patents. I also co-founded a startup, **Hubris by SAP**, under the sponsorship of SAP. One
of my research projects in the field of Autonomous Databases formed the base of this startup. It was a short-lived
venture spanning nearly a year.

Outside of my work, I love playing video games across various platforms, including PlayStation, mobile, and board games.
Iâ€™m also an avid reader and enjoy exploring new books in my free time.
