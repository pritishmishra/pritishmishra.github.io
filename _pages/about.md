## About Me
I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.toronto.edu/). I am part of [Computer Systems and Networks Group](http://csng.cs.toronto.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Eyal de Lara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/). Prior to this, I worked as a Developer in the SAP Cloud Platform team at [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/corporate/en/company/innovation/sap-labs.html), India. My primary research interests are in the domain of **Distributed Systems** mainly encompassing Edge Computing, Serverless in Edge, Cloud computing and IoT. Like most of the community, I too occassionally dabble in the applications of Machine Learning. 

During my stint at SAP Labs, I was a major contributor to many open-source projects. I also got an opportunity to publish 8 papers and file 8 patents. I also co-founded a startup, **Hubris by SAP**, under the sponsorship of SAP. One of my research projects in the field of Autonomous Databases formed the base of this startup. It was a short-lived venture spanning nearly a year.

You can find a lot of information about my work in this website: my projects, publications, work experience, awards/recognitions and more!
